Title: Dynamic Routing Using RIP

Description:

Here we will delve into the dynamic world of routing and explores the usage of the RIP (Routing Information Protocol) for dynamic IP routing using Cisco Packet Tracer. This hands-on lab provides a comprehensive guide on configuring routers, implementing RIP, and designing a dynamic routing network.

Understanding Dynamic Routing:

Dynamic routing, often referred to as adaptive routing, allows routers to forward data based on current network conditions. It enables networks to adapt to changes, such as node or connection loss, by rerouting traffic when alternative paths are available. This is in contrast to static routing, where routes are fixed and unaltered by network changes.

Exploring RIP:

RIP, the Routing Information Protocol, is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) designed to distribute routing information within an Autonomous System (AS). RIP is a vector routing protocol that relies on routers exchanging network reachability information with their neighbors. Routers communicate the destinations they can reach, along with the next hop address to reach those destinations. RIP helps routers determine the best path to forward packets.

How RIP Works:

In brief, the RIP protocol operates as follows:

Each router initializes its routing table with locally connected networks.
Periodically, routers advertise their routing tables over RIP-enabled interfaces.
Routers receiving these advertisements update their routing tables, incorporating the new routes.
If a router stops receiving advertisements for a particular route, it eventually times out that route, marking it as unreachable.
RIP utilizes metrics to measure the "distance" to a route's destination. Shorter routes are preferred.
RIP optimizes route stability by sending triggered updates upon changes, rapidly notifying neighbors.
Unreachable routes are advertised with a metric of 16, marking them as unreachable.
"Split horizon with poison reverse" prevents misinterpretation of routing information.
A "Request" message allows a newly-started router to query its neighbors' routing tables.
Lab Objectives:

The primary goal of this lab is to enable students to:

Configure routers within Cisco Packet Tracer.
Implement dynamic IP routing using the Command Line Interface (CLI).
Construct and design a RIP network.
Configure routers to use serial cables and DCE/DTE devices.
Enable RIP on routers.
Test and verify RIP routing.
Walk-through Tasks:

Let's embark on this journey of dynamic routing using RIP with the following steps:

Creating the Topology:

Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
Add three 2811 routers.
Include three switches.
Add WIC serial ports to routers to facilitate connections.
Attach PC devices to the switches.
Configuring Interfaces:

Access the CLI of each router, enabling the interfaces by configuring IP addresses and subnet masks. Configure the clock rate for DCE ports.
Configure the PCs by assigning them the appropriate IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways.
Enabling RIP Protocol:

To enable RIP, access global configuration mode and use the "router rip" command.
In routing configuration mode, use the "network" command to enable RIP on interfaces belonging to the specified network.
For instance, on R1:
Enter "router rip" in global configuration mode.
Use the "network" command to enable RIP for networks 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0.
Save the configuration and exit.
Verify RIP Routing:

Verify the RIP routing configuration by using the "show ip route" command. You'll see routes marked with 'R' in yellow, indicating they were configured using RIP.
Send a PDU from one PC to another to confirm that dynamic routing is functioning correctly.
Practice Tasks:

For further practice, a task is assigned:

Task 1:

Construct the given topology.
Configure RIP for dynamic routing.
Configure all interfaces (serial or Fast Ethernet).
Send PDUs to test the routing configuration.
Show the results to ensure RIP is functioning correctly.
In summary, this lab equips you with practical experience in network configuration, dynamic routing using RIP, and network design. Whether you're new to networking or looking to reinforce your knowledge, this lab provides valuable insights and hands-on practice. Happy networking!
