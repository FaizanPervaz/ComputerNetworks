Subnetting and Dynamic Routing Lab
This repository contains practical exercises and guidelines for understanding subnetting and implementing dynamic routing protocols in computer networks.

Overview
Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks. This practice optimizes network performance, enhances security, and efficiently utilizes IP addresses.

Understanding Subnetting
The repository includes comprehensive explanations and practice examples covering:

Network Classes and Hosts: Detailing the classification of networks into Classes A, B, and C, along with the number of hosts each class supports.
Eligible Bits for Subnetting: Explaining the bits available for subnetting within each network class.
Calculating Subnets and Hosts: Step-by-step guides and calculations for subnetting given IP addresses, required hosts, and subnets.
Lab Tasks
The repository offers lab tasks focusing on subnetting scenarios, such as:

Practice Examples: Walkthroughs of subnetting scenarios, requiring subnet identification and address allocation based on specified hosts and subnets.
Configuration Topologies: Detailed topologies and instructions for configuring networks based on subnetting requirements.
Dynamic Routing Implementation: Instructions and guidance for implementing dynamic routing protocols, such as RIP (Routing Information Protocol), within the configured network topologies.
Usage
Subnetting Examples
Practice subnetting by following the provided scenarios in the task descriptions:

Identify Subnets: Use the given IP addresses, required hosts, and subnets to perform subnetting calculations.
Determine Subnet Containment: Find which subnet contains the given IP address based on the calculated subnets.
Lab Task Execution
Execute the lab tasks by:

Topology Configuration: Create and configure network topologies as described in the lab task instructions.
Dynamic Routing Setup: Implement dynamic routing protocols, like RIP, within the configured network topologies.
