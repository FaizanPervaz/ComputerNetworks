Title: Introduction to Cisco Packet Tracer

Description:

Week 5 of our networking course brings us an exciting hands-on experience with Cisco Packet Tracer, a powerful network simulator tool. In this practical lab, you will delve into the world of networking, exploring concepts and technologies using an almost unlimited number of virtual devices, without the need to invest in physical Cisco routers or switches.

Cisco Packet Tracer offers students an invaluable platform to grasp the principles of networking and to nurture Cisco-specific skills. Developed by Cisco Systems, it's a fantastic tool for both beginners and those looking to enhance their knowledge.

Network Topology:

Network topology forms the foundation of every communication network. It defines the structure of connections, nodes, and elements in a network. Whether depicted physically or logically, understanding network topology is essential in building robust networks.

IPv4 Classes:

Dive into the world of IP addressing and learn about the five classes of IPv4 addresses, including public and private IP ranges. Grasp the significance of subnet masks, the number of networks, and the number of hosts per network within each class.

Getting Started with Packet Tracer:

Learn how to launch Packet Tracer and familiarize yourself with the devices you'll use in the labs. Explore various router models like 2811, switches like 2960-24TT, or generic end devices such as PCs or laptops. Understand different types of connections like copper crossover, copper straight-through, and serial DTE used between routers.

Network Configuration:

Set up your devices with the appropriate network interface cards (NICs).
Enable port labels for clarity and ease of use.
Lab Tasks:

This lab will guide you in configuring a network topology using Class C IP addresses. You will learn how to assign IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways to devices in your virtual network.

Router Configuration: Understand the basics of router configuration by accessing the Command Line Interface (CLI). Set up IP addresses, subnet masks, and activate the interface to establish network connections.

Assigning IPs to PCs: Dive into the world of end devices. Learn how to configure IP addresses on your PCs, specify subnet masks, and set gateway addresses.

Lab Task: For the practical part of the lab, configure the remaining devices using Class C IP addresses. Your specific task is to assign IPs based on the last two digits of your roll number. Test the network by sending packets and ensure successful communication. When you're finished, save your Packet Tracer file (.pkt) following the naming convention "i21-XXXX_Lab5.pkt," with the last two digits of your roll number as the second octet.
