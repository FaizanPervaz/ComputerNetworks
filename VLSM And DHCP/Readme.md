DHCP Overview:
DHCP automates the configuration process of devices on a network, assigning IP addresses and other parameters. Key concepts include dynamic IP assignment, components (server, client), IP address pools, lease duration, and the DORA (Discover-Offer-Request-Acknowledge) process.

DHCP Configuration Steps:
DHCP Server Configuration:
Installation, IP address range definition, lease durations, and configuration options.
DHCP Client Configuration:
Most devices are DHCP clients by default, configured to obtain IPs automatically.
DHCP Relay Agent:
Utilized in larger networks to forward requests across multiple subnets.
Packet Tracer DHCP Configuration:
DHCP Server Setup: Configuring DHCP pools and IP configurations, managing IP address assignments.
Router Configuration for Subnets: Setting up DHCP for different subnets using router interfaces and helper addresses.
Common Issues and Troubleshooting:
Addressing IP conflicts, lease renewal issues, server availability checks, network segmentation concerns, and security considerations like rogue DHCP servers and IP Address Management (IPAM).

Lab Tasks:
VLSM Setup: Design an IP addressing scheme using VLSM, assign IPs to router interfaces.
DHCP Server Configuration: Set up DHCP server pools and scopes for each subnet.
Router Configuration: Configure router interfaces and enable routing across subnets.
DHCP Testing: Verify DHCP functionality for connected PCs on different subnets.
VLSM and DHCP Integration: Test DHCP across various subnets, monitor logs, and troubleshoot issues.
Conclusion:
The lab aims to provide hands-on experience in combining DHCP with VLSM for efficient IP address management. Documenting configurations, aligning lease durations, experimenting with configurations, and understanding their impact are crucial for real-world networking scenarios.

This comprehensive lab manual covers DHCP fundamentals, configurations, troubleshooting, and integration with VLSM, offering practical insights into managing IP addresses in networks.
