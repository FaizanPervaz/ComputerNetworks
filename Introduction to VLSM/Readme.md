Introduction to VLSM:
VLSM allows subnets to be of variable size within a single class A, B, or C network. It improves subnet usability by allocating subnet masks based on varying subnet size requirements.

How to do Subnetting with VLSM:
Determine Host Requirements:

Identify the number of hosts needed in each LAN/WAN segment.
Choose IP Subnet Class:

Based on host count, select an appropriate subnet class.
Host Bits per Subnet:

Determine the number of host bits needed to accommodate the hosts in each subnet.
Calculate Subnet Mask:

Generate subnet masks for each subnet based on the required host bits.
Determine Increment:

Calculate the increment based on the number of host bits.
Network, Broadcast, and Usable IP Range:

Identify network addresses, broadcast addresses, and usable IP ranges for each subnet.
Implementing VLSM:
Allocate subnets for each LAN/WAN segment based on the calculated subnet masks and IP ranges.
VLSM in Cisco Packet Tracer:
Create Network Topology:

Use PCs, switches, and routers to design the network topology.
Configure Devices:

Assign IPv4 addresses and subnet masks to PCs and routers based on the provided IP addressing table.
Assign IP Addresses to PCs:

Configure IPv4 addresses using the IP configuration settings or command line (cmd) on PCs.
Configure Router Interfaces:

Set IPv4 addresses and subnet masks for router interfaces according to the IP addressing table.
Assign Static Routes:

Configure static routes on routers to define paths to specific networks.
Verification via Ping:

Verify network connectivity by pinging IP addresses of different PCs or nodes.
Simulation:

Simulate data transfer by sending PDUs (Protocol Data Units) between PCs to ensure connectivity.
Lab Task:
Design the VLSM architecture within Cisco Packet Tracer based on the provided IP addressing and network requirements.
