Title: Routers with Multiple Networks and Static Routing

Description:

Here, We dive into the fascinating world of routing and explore the concepts of IP static routing using Cisco Packet Tracer. This hands-on lab provides a comprehensive guide on configuring routers and creating a network topology with multiple networks and static routing.

Understanding Routing:

Before we get into the lab, let's grasp the fundamentals. Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network, enabling data to travel across multiple networks. In the realm of computer networks, IP Routing plays a vital role, determining how data moves from its source to its destination. IP Routing protocols empower routers to establish forwarding tables, mapping final destinations to next-hop addresses.

Static Routing Advantages:

Static routing, a key focus of this lab, provides network administrators with a manual approach to route configuration. Unlike dynamic routing, static routes don't change when the network is reconfigured, offering advantages such as minimal load on router CPUs and network administrator control.

Lab Objectives:

The primary goal of this lab is to enable students to:

Configure routers within Cisco Packet Tracer.
Perform IP static routing using the Command Line Interface (CLI).
Configure static routing using the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Create a network with multiple routers and multiple networks.
Walk-through Tasks:

Let's walk through the essential steps for this lab:

Creating the Topology:

Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
Add two routers from the Network Devices tab.
Include two switches via the Switches tab.
Integrate two PCs from the End Devices tab.
Connect the two routers using a copper cross cable.
Establish connections between routers and switches using copper straight-through cables.
Connect the PCs to the switches using copper straight-through cables.
Configuring Routers:

Access the router's CLI by clicking on it.
Enter "enable" (or "en") to gain privileged mode for router configuration.
Use the "configure terminal" (or "config t") command to enter the configuration mode.
Add IP addresses and subnet masks to router interfaces.
Turn on interfaces using the "no shut" command.
Repeat the configuration steps for both routers and their interfaces.
Configuring PCs:

Configure IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways for PCs.
Ensure PC0's IP address is 192.168.12.2 and PC1's is 192.168.11.1.
Testing the Network:

Attempt to send a PDU from PC0 to PC1. Observe the failed communication due to different networks.
Access the router's CLI to examine the routing table. You'll notice it has no route to the other network.
Static Routing Configuration:

Utilize the "ip route" command to set up a static route, specifying the destination network and the next-hop address.
Repeat the static route configuration for the second router.
Successful Communication:

After configuring static routes, test network communication again. You will now observe successful PDU transmission.
Practice Tasks:

For further practice, two tasks are assigned:

Task 1:

Construct a network topology with three routers, three switches, and six PCs.
Assign proper hostnames to routers and switches.
Initialize the network with IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways for PCs.
Configure routers for their respective networks and implement static routing.

Task 2:

Create a network with two routers and six switches.
Each router connects to three switches, forming a tree-like structure.
Connect four PCs to each network.
Assign hostnames, IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways.
Configure routers for their respective networks and set up static routing.
Test PDU transmission from various paths using PCs and display routing tables with static routes.
This lab equips you with practical experience in network configuration and routing, essential skills for anyone delving into the world of computer networks. Whether you're a networking novice or looking to refine your expertise, this lab offers valuable insights and hands-on practice. Happy networking!
