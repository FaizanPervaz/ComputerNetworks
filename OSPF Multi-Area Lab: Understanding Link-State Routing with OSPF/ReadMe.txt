OSPF Multi-Area Lab: Understanding Link-State Routing with OSPF
This repository comprises detailed guidelines and practical exercises aimed at comprehending the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol and implementing multi-area OSPF configurations within a network topology using CISCO Packet Tracer.

Overview
Understanding Link-State Routing and OSPF
Link-state routing protocols, exemplified by OSPF, create a topological map of the network, aiding routers in determining the shortest path to each network. OSPF, built around Dijkstra's shortest path first (SPF) algorithm, excels in dynamically computing and maintaining efficient routing tables.

OSPF Protocol in Multi-Area Configurations
OSPF operates as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), efficiently finding optimal packet paths within a network. The protocol utilizes a dynamic approach to update routing tables, unlike its predecessors like RIP, enhancing convergence time and reducing unnecessary information exchanges.

Tools Required
CISCO Packet Tracer: Required for creating and configuring the network topology.
Experiment Objectives
Upon completion of this lab, participants will:

Cable a network according to the provided Topology Diagram.
Perform basic configuration tasks on routers and interfaces.
Configure OSPF routing on multiple routers across different areas.
Verify OSPF routing using show commands and routing tables.
Walkthrough Tasks
Task 1: Constructing Multi-Area OSPF Topology
Open CISCO Packet Tracer and build the topology as depicted in the provided diagram.
Add routers, switches, and PCs from the toolbox to the workspace.
Configure router interfaces with respective IP addresses and clock rates for serial interfaces.
Assign IP addresses and default gateways to all PCs in the network.
Configure OSPF routing on routers within respective areas using the router ospf command and specifying network addresses and area IDs.
Verify OSPF routing by examining routing tables using the show ip route command on routers.
Validate OSPF functionality by pinging from one PC to another across the network.
Practice Task 1
Create the topology outlined in the provided diagram.
Configure multi-area OSPF routing on routers within the topology.
Assign IP addresses to router interfaces and PCs.
Configure OSPF area-wise on respective routers.
Configure DCE and DTE ports before OSPF configuration.
Verify OSPF routing tables on each configured router.
Conduct ping tests and send PDUs between specific PCs as instructed.
