This syllabus covers a comprehensive range of topics from foundational concepts of socket programming to practical hands-on labs dealing with various dynamic routing protocols and their implementations in network configurations.

1. Introduction to Socket Programming:
  Basics of communication between computers using sockets for network applications.
2. Socket Programming - TCP Client-Server:
  Understanding and implementing communication protocols using TCP for client-server interactions.
3. Socket Programming - UDP Client-Server:
  Understanding and implementing communication protocols using UDP for client-server interactions.
4. Socket Programming: TCP and UDP Concurrent Servers:
  Implementing servers capable of handling multiple clients concurrently using TCP and UDP protocols.
5. Computer Networks Exam:
  An examination, likely assessing understanding and application of network-related concepts covered in the course.
6. Intro To Cisco Packet:
  Introduction to using Cisco Packet Tracer, a simulation tool for network design, configuration, and troubleshooting.
7. Routers with Multiple Networks and Static Routing:
  Configuration and understanding of routers managing multiple networks using static routing.
8. Dynamic Routing Using RIP:
  Implementation and understanding of dynamic routing using the RIP (Routing Information Protocol).
9. Subnetting and Dynamic Routing Lab:
  Practical exercises focusing on subnetting techniques alongside dynamic routing protocols.
10. EIGRP Lab: Understanding Dynamic Routing with EIGRP:
  Lab sessions exploring EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) for dynamic routing.
11. OSPF Multi-Area Lab: Understanding Link-State Routing with OSPF:
  Lab sessions centered around OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol for understanding link-state routing in multiple areas.
12. Introduction to VLSM
  VLSM allows subnets to be of variable size within a single class A, B, or C network. It improves subnet usability by allocating subnet masks based on varying subnet size requirements.
